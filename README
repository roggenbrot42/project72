Project72
===========

Project72 will be a Sokoban player/solver.
Currently, it's written in Python and uses curses for display of the maze.

The current code allows for an arbitrary amount of goals, as long as they can fit inside the maze.
The game logic is implemented, but surely not very efficiently.

The current computer player performs a true random walk.

Future improvements I have in mind for the random player are:
+ check if a move is idempotent in the sense that it didn't change anything
+ as long as nothing was changed, mark a place as visited (0-1goback-2dontreturn) to reduce unnecessary moves
+ find all *reachable* places in the maze
+ store all moves

Moving away from the random player, to a more intelligent solution:
+ (this might be complicated) check if a move is reversible

+ start out with selecting next best stone
1 find all directions in which it can be pushed
2 path to every place around the stone corresponding to a push direction
3 push the stone
4 goto 3

+ memorize all previous game states (excluding ones that didn't introduce change)
+ if state equals a previous one with fewer moves, drop current path and proceed on the previous path.
